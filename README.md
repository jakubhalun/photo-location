## Photo Location (JPEG to KML Matcher)
This project is designed to match the location from a KML (Keyhole Markup Language)
file with the original date of creation from a JPEG file.
By comparing the timestamps, it provides an insightful correlation between the image and
its possible geographical location at the time it was taken.

It is a desktop application (designed using JavaFX). JPEG and KML are provided by drag and dropping
them into a proper text boxes of the application window.
