## Photo Location
This project is designed to match the location from a KML (Keyhole Markup Language)
file with the original date of creation from a JPEG file.
By comparing the timestamps, it provides an insightful correlation between the image and
its possible geographical location at the time it was taken.

### Building the project

./gradlew shadowJar
